Create a poker hand checker.  Experiment with enumerable methods.  There is no one correct way.  Interesting to see approaches and discuss.

1.  Create a card constructor,  card has suit and a number
2.  Create a hand constructor, hand has 5 cards.
3.  Check in the deck if there is a pair(countBy)
4.  Check if there are two pairs(countBy)
5.  Check if there is three of a kind(countBy)
6.  Check if there is is a straight(each)
7.  Check if there is a flush(reduce)
8.  Check if there is a full house(countBy)
