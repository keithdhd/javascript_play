# JS Module Pattern

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the module pattern in JavaScript
- Implement a modular 

## What is it?
The ***module pattern*** is a way to emulate classes in other languages.

In class based languages, classes can have private properties and methods. This means they are not available to other objects in the program.

We can't call a private method or alter a private variable.

However, JavaScript does not have this ability. But it does have ***closures***!

We can take advantage of this characteristic of JS to implement private and public variables and methods and it helps make our code more portable.
