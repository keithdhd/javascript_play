Let's imagine that we need to get supplies for our new colony on our planet. Supplies are many lightyears away on a different planet, so we need to send a ship to go get them.

However, our planet needs to continue to function normally until the ship gets back. We have plenty food until they return, but in the mean time we need to hold an election and possibly have a civil war.

We are going to need some way of storing the inhabitants of our planet and who the current Prime Minister is.

We need to achieve three things:

 - Send off a ship to get supplies which will inform us when it has returned
 -	Hold an election, which changes the Prime Minister
 - Have a civil war, which removes the current Prime Minister from the planet's inhabitants and sets a new one.

We should log messages to the terminal so that we can see when these things happen.

The supply ship must be sent off before the election and the civil war, and return after these events have ended.
