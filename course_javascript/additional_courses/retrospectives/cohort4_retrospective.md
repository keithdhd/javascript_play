Week 1

Day 1

  - if(true) caused a bit of confusion  
  - Try to get 5 or 6 lessons done in the morning - otherwise might run out of time. There's a Keynote presentation for the history of JS. Don't spend too long on this but they found it interesting. 
  - Do functions before objects? 
  - We do a whole lesson on objects on day 2 so the hashes lesson feels a bit redundant. Combine?
  - Anonymous functions bit in functions lesson needs clarified - not very meaningful
  - Need a (short) stand alone 'this' lesson

Day 2 
  
  - npm - make it clear when we USE our package as opposed to creating it. Got a bit blurred.

Day 3

  - Prototype lesson. Some students went off to try multiple inheritance in the hero and rat :(


Week 2

 - Draw DOM or HTML page as a tree to clarify appending etc. When JS came along we got methods to interact with this tree.
 - Seeing the document methods is overwhelming - "which ones am I supposed to use?"
 - Need a CORS cheat sheet for instructors. At least one student or group get CORS errors.
 - Didn't feel like they fully digested the design patterns for the bank and countries and bucket list solutions. Do a lesson on this?

Week 3

 - No need for node intro this week. Maybe move to week 1 or expand on node intro in week 1 instead.
 - After day 1 water bottle, homework doing the same with RecordStore or other week 1 homework worked well.
