# JS Record Store 

Your task for your weekend homework is to model a Record Store using JavaScript. As usual this should all be TDD!

Try to use constructors and prototypes throughout as well.

## Part A

- Create a Record object that has an Artist, Title and Price
- Create a Record Store that has a Name, City and an Inventory.
- Give the Record Store a Balance. 
- Add some Records to the Store's Inventory.

## Part B

- Create a method that prints out the Records details as a string.
- Create a method that lists the inventory.
- Create a method so the Record Store can sell a Record and adjusts the Store's balance to account for the Record being sold.
- Create a method that reports the finnancial situation of the Store. Balance and value of inventory.

## Part C

- Create a RecordCollector (or Customer) constructor who can buy and sell records.
- The RecordCollector should have cash that increase and decreases with buying and selling.
- The RecordCollector shouldn't be able to buy a Record if he can't afford it.

## Extension

- If you haven't already refactor your code to use enumeration throughout.
