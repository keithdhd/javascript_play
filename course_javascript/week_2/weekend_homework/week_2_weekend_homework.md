# Weekend homework.

## Key learning to practise and/or revise:

 - Manipulating the DOM - selecting/creating/appending elements
 - Using event listeners to make our apps interactive
 - Making an HTTP request to retrieve some data and then using it 

## Task:

Practise what we've done this week using JavaScript in the browser:

Fetch information from an API.
Display/Analyse the information in the browser - using DOM manipulation/Charts/Maps/Canvas etc. Be creative! If you want to focus on Maps / Canvas without getting outside data from an API that's fine, but you should revise the HTTP requests lesson to make sure you're confident with them.

Recommended APIs:

  - REST countries: https://restcountries.eu/
  - Pokemon API: http://pokeapi.co/
  - Football Data: http://api.football-data.org/index - Free API key when you sign up.
  - OMDB - Film info: http://www.omdbapi.com/ - no key needed.
  - New York Times: http://developer.nytimes.com/ - article search, movie reviews. Free API key on sign up. 
  - Giphy API: https://github.com/Giphy/GiphyAPI - fun gifs! Free key provided. 
  - Open Weather Map: http://openweathermap.org/api - Free API key on sign up.
  - Flickr - photos: https://www.flickr.com/services/api/ - may need a Flickr account.
  - Harry Potter: http://hp-api.herokuapp.com/
  - Spotify: https://developer.spotify.com/web-api/ - their ‘Code Examples and Libraries’ page gives some nice examples. No API key needed for some parts, Spotify account needed for others (a free account should be fine).
  - MusixMatch: https://developer.musixmatch.com/ - get info on music charts, artists and their music, lyrics. Free API key when you sign up. 

(All of the above have been tested by instructors and are fairly easy to use. There are loads more APIs out there which you're welcome to use, but make sure to check that a) you can access the data without too much struggle and b) the data is in a usable format, before getting too far into using one. 

We DON'T recommend you use the Marvel API as it's a real hassle, or anything with OAuth/complex authentication.)
