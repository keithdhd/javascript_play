# Webpack Bank Homework

Our app.js is a bit scrappy at the moment.

Let's refactor it to be more object orientated.

Task:
  
  - Create a new BankView constructor that takes in a bank object as an argument and just deals with DOM interactions.
  - BankView should have a method on it that will render the bank details to the browser.
  - Create a 'new' BankView in app.js and pass a bank object to it.

# Webpack RecordStore Homework

Take the RecordStore that we did in week 1 and create a browser UI for it. Create a sample.json which should be an array of objects to represent Records.

Just as we did with the Bank, create a new RecordStore and add all the records using the sample.json data.

It should: 
  
  - Display the name and city of the RecordStore
  - Display the inventory list

Further:
  
  - Add a FORM to add a new Record to the RecordStore.
  - Add ability to sell record
