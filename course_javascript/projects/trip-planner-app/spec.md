# Trip Planner (Trippi)

Goal: Practice accessing data from an API and rendering it to a webpage.

You are required to build a day trip planner using Google Maps API and Google Places API. Users should be able to find out about interesting places or events near to where they're planning to go and save the ones they like most into an itinerary.

## MVP
- Users should be able to select a location
- Be able to see local places of interest
- Create an itinerary of the places they wish to visit that day.


## Extensions -
- Users should be able to persist data to a DB
- Users can create a “road trip” of different cities and places to visit as they travel.
