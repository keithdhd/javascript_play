# Educational App

The BBC are looking to improve their online offering of educational content by developing some interactive apps that display information in a fun and interesting way. Your task is to make an MVP to put forward to them - this may only be for a small set of information, and may only showcase some of the features to be included in the final app. You might use an API to bring in content or a database to store facts. The topic of the app is your choice, but here are some suggestions you could look into:

- Interactive timeline, e.g. of the history of computer programming
- Explore the Solar System - navigate through planets and display information
- Interactive map of a historical event - e.g. World War 1, the travels of Christopher Columbus

## MVP

- Display some information about a particular topic in an interesting way
- Have some user interactivity using event listeners, e.g to move through different sections of content 

## Examples of further features

- Bring in data using an API or create your own
- Use charts, maps or the canvas to display your information
- Take in some user input (e.g. name, birthday) and use this to personalise the experience.

See sample.md for some examples for inspiration.
