## Shares App

More and more people are playing the stock market. A local trader has come to you with a portoflio of shares. She wants to be able to analyse it more effectively. She has a small sample data set to give you and would like you to build a minimal viable product (MVP) that uses the data to display her portfolio in useful ways so that she can make better decisions.

## MVP
- View total current value of the portfolio
- View information for individual shares held
- View performance trends for individual stocks and the portfolio as a whole

## Examples of further features

- Speculation based on trends - e.g. what might the value be in 2 weeks?. 
- Checking current prices using a stocks API.
- Ability to 'buy'/add more stocks to the portfolio and 'sell'/remove them and update total value.
- Create targets and show how long it might take to meet them.

There is some sample data provided but you are free to modify this, write your own sample data, or pull it from another source.
